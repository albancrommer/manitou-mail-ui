Translation files for Manitou-Mail user interface.

This directory contains *.ts text files for manitou Qt user's interface.
Each of these files are named manitou_xx.ts where xx is the code
of the language (ex: manitou_fr.ts for french).

At launch time, manitou gets the language from its environment
(typically through the LANG variable), then searches for a compiled
version of a translation files, named manitou_xx.qm and uses it
if available. The files should have been installed under
the $datadir/manitou/translations directory, where $datadir
defaults to $prefix/share and $prefix defaults to /usr/local.

The ts files are maintained using Trolltech Qt 'linguist' application.
See http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/linguist-manual.html for a complete
documentation.
Compilation of translation files is done by the 'lrelease' Qt utility.

Both 'linguist' and 'lrelease' are part of Trolltech GPL source code
archives for the Qt library.

When using a pre-compiled libqt package set up by a third party, these
tools may be available separately from the library; for example
they're in the qt4-dev-tools and libqt4-dev in debian distributions.
